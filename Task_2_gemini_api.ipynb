      "Response:\n",
      "Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both chronic conditions affecting how your body regulates blood sugar (glucose), but they differ significantly in their causes and how they're managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Type 1 Diabetes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Cause:**  An autoimmune reaction destroys the insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas.  This means the body produces little to no insulin.  This is not preventable through lifestyle changes.  It's often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, but can develop at any age.\n",
      "* **Insulin Dependence:**  People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections or an insulin pump to survive.  Insulin is absolutely necessary to allow glucose to enter cells and be used for energy.\n",
      "* **Symptoms:** Often appear suddenly and can include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger, and fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Type 2 Diabetes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Cause:**  The body either doesn't produce enough insulin, or the cells don't respond properly to the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance). This often develops gradually over time and is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.  It's more common in adults, but is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adolescents.\n",
      "* **Insulin Dependence:**  Many people with type 2 diabetes can initially manage their blood sugar with lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight loss), oral medications, or both.  However, some individuals will eventually require insulin injections as the disease progresses.\n",
      "* **Symptoms:**  Symptoms may be subtle and develop slowly.  They can include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and frequent infections.  Many people with type 2 diabetes are asymptomatic initially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong insulin therapy, while type 2 diabetes is often (but not always) manageable with lifestyle changes and/or medications, and may eventually require insulin.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management of either type of diabetes.

      "\n",
      "**Type 1 diabetes** is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.  This means the body produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow glucose (sugar) from food to enter the cells for energy.  Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence, but it can appear at any age.  It requires lifelong insulin therapy to manage blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Type 2 diabetes** is a more complex condition where the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or the cells don't respond properly to the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance).  This leads to a buildup of glucose in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history. While some individuals with type 2 diabetes may eventually need insulin, it's often initially managed through lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight loss) and oral medications.\n",
