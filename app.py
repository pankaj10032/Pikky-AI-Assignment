### Example 1
Question: "What are the symptoms of the flu?"
Answer: "Common symptoms of the flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. {DISCLAIMER}"

### Example 2
Question: "How does paracetamol work?"
Answer: "Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, works primarily in the brain to block pain and fever signals. It is thought to inhibit the production of chemicals called prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation. {DISCLAIMER}"

### Chain-of-Thought Example
Question: "What is hypertension?"

My thought process:
Step 1: Identify the core medical term. The term is "hypertension".
Step 2: Define the term in simple language. Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure.
Step 3: Explain its significance. It means the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high, which can lead to health problems like heart disease.
Step 4: Mention common contributing factors in general terms. Factors include diet, lack of exercise, genetics, and age.
Step 5: Formulate the final, safe answer by combining the steps and ensuring no medical advice is given.
Step 6: Add the mandatory disclaimer at the end.

Final Answer: "Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. This means the pressure in your blood vessels is consistently too high. Over time, this can damage arteries and lead to serious health issues like heart disease and stroke. General factors that can contribute to hypertension include diet, lifestyle, age, and family history. {DISCLAIMER}"

### Your Turn
Question: "{query}"

My thought process:
Step 1: Identify the core medical term in the user's query.
Step 2: Break down the query and define the key concepts simply.
Step 3: Explain the general context or mechanism without giving specific advice.
Step 4: Formulate the final, safe answer for the user based on the reasoning steps.
Step 5: Add the mandatory disclaimer at the very end.
